#  Gambling in Black Hawk, Colorado started in the 1800s!

Long before the days of legal gambling in Black Hawk, Colorado, miners and settlers were enjoying games of chance in the town’s rough-and-tumble saloons.

The first mention of gambling in Black Hawk came on October 18, 1859, when a voter referendum was held to allow public gaming in the town. Nearly all of the eligible voters turned out for the referendum and it passed by a wide margin.

Several weeks later, on November 7, 1859, the first game of Faro (an early form of poker) was played in one of Black Hawk’s saloons. Gambling continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1800s and soon dozens of gaming halls were operating in the town.

As Black Hawk grew into a major tourist destination, so did its gambling industry. The biggest casinos in town could accommodate several hundred players at a time and offered all sorts of table games and slot machines.

For many years, gambling was the primary source of revenue for Black Hawk’s businesses and government. In fact, up until the early 2000s, 75% to 80% of all revenue generated by the town came from gambling taxes and fees.

But with the legalization of casinos in other Colorado towns – including Denver – Black Hawk’s gambling industry has taken a hit in recent years. The number of casino visitors has declined dramatically and as a result, many businesses have closed their doors.

Even so, Black Hawk remains one of Colorado’s most popular tourist destinations and its casinos continue to offer some of the best gaming action around. So if you’re looking for a good time and want to try your luck at some exciting table games or slots machines, be sure to pay a visit to Black Hawk!
