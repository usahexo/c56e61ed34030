#  Mavericks Aim to Bounce Back after Late-Season Slump

The Dallas Mavericks are coming off of a tough season, which saw them miss the playoffs after being one of the top teams in the Western Conference for most of the year. This disappointing end to the season was due in part to an extended slump that hit the team in late March and lasted through the end of the regular season.

Now, heading into the offseason, Mavericks players and coaches are looking to bounce back and return to their winning ways. One of the main goals for Dallas this offseason is to improve their defense, as they were one of the worst defensive teams in the league last year. They will also need to find a way to replace outgoing veterans Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Kidd, both of whom have retired from the NBA.

Despite these challenges, there is plenty of talent on this Mavericks team and they should be able to compete for a playoff spot next season. Luka Doncic impressed as a rookie last year and is poised for a breakout season in 2019-20. DeAndre Jordan is still one of the best centers in the league and Harrison Barnes provides scoring depth. The key for Dallas will be getting consistent production from their bench players, something they struggled with last year.

If everything falls into place, Mavericks fans can expect another exciting season full of highlights from Doncic and Jordan. The future looks bright for this team and they should be contenders for many years to come.

#  Dallas Looks to Take Advantage of Struggling Rockets

The Dallas Mavericks (15-8) will attempt to take advantage of a struggling Houston Rockets (10-12) squad when the two teams square off at the Toyota Center on Friday night.

Houston had won five straight games before suffering back-to-back losses to the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings this past week. The Rockets are hoping that their All-Star center, Clint Capela, will be able to return to the lineup after missing the past four games with a right shoulder injury.

Dallas enters Friday’s contest having lost three of its last four games. The Mavs are led by point guard Dennis Smith Jr., who is averaging 16.8 points and 4.5 assists per game this season. Harrison Barnes is also having a solid year for Dallas, averaging 17.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.

Houston has won 10 of the 14 meetings between these two teams since 2013-14, but Dallas has won the past two matchups, including a 122-118 victory on November 10th of this season. Look for the Mavericks to take advantage of a Rockets team that is struggling defensively, allowing 109.4 points per game this season.

#  Could Westbrook's Injury Benefit the Mavericks?

The Oklahoma City Thunder are in a difficult position after superstar point guard Russell Westbrook sustained a knee injury that will sideline him for the remainder of the 2017-2018 season. Westbrook's injury opens up an opportunity for the Dallas Mavericks, who are currently in the 9th spot in the Western Conference playoff race.

The Mavericks are a young team with plenty of talent, including rookie Dennis Smith Jr. and second-year player Harrison Barnes. With Westbrook out of the picture, the Mavericks now have a chance to move up in the standings and make a run at the playoffs.

Westbrook is one of the most dominant players in the NBA, so it will be difficult for the Thunder to replace his production. The Thunder will have to rely on players like Paul George and Carmelo Anthony to carry them through the rest of the season.

The Mavericks will likely face an uphill battle against teams like the Spurs, Rockets, and Warriors in the Western Conference playoffs, but they have shown that they are capable of competing with anyone. With Westbrook out of the picture, this could be their chance to make some noise in the postseason.

#  5 Factors that Will Decide the Series

The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors will face each other for the fourth straight year in the NBA Finals. The pressure is on for both teams to win, especially for LeBron James and Steph Curry who are facing off against each other once again.

The Cavs have made it to the Finals despite being without their best player, Kevin Love. They’ve also had to deal with injuries to George Hill and Rodney Hood. Despite all of this, they were able to defeat the Celtics in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals.

The Warriors have been dominant all season long and are seeking their third championship in four years. They finished with the best record in the NBA and have only lost two games in the playoffs so far.

Here are five factors that will decide the series:

1. LeBron James vs. Steph Curry

This matchup has been one of the most intriguing ones in recent NBA history. Both players are regarded as some of the best players of all time and they always seem to bring out the best in each other. Whoever has the better performance in this series will likely come out on top.

2. The role players

Despite being without Love, Hill, and Hood, the Cavs still have some very good players coming off of the bench. Guys like Kyle Korver, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, and Deron Williams can make a big impact in this series if they step up their game.

The Warriors also have some excellent role players who can step up when needed. Guys like Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, David West, and Klay Thompson can make a big difference in this series.

3. The health of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant

Kyrie Irving is coming back from a knee injury and it’s unclear if he’ll be able to play at 100 percent during the Finals. Kevin Durant is also nursing an ankle injury but is expected to be ready for Game 1. If either player is limited or unable to play, it will be a major blow to their team’s chances of winning.

4. The home-court advantage

The Warriors have been incredibly dominant at home this season but the Cavs have shown that they can win on the road as well. Whoever wins more games on their opponent’s home court will likely come out victorious in the series.

5. Intangibles
