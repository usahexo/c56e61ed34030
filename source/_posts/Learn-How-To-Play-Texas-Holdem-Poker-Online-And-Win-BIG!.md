#  Learn How To Play Texas Holdem Poker Online And Win BIG!

Texas holdem poker is one of the most popular card games in the world. It is a game of skill, strategy and chance. The object of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the two hole cards and the five community cards.

There are many different ways to play Texas holdem poker. The most common variant is No Limit Texas Holdem, which is the version that is played in tournaments and at the World Series of Poker. In No Limit Texas Holdem, players can bet any amount of money they have in front of them, up to all of their chips.

Another variant of Texas holdem poker is Pot Limit Texas Holdem. In Pot Limit Texas Holdem, players can bet any amount that is equal to or less than the size of the pot. The final variant of Texas holdem poker is Fixed Limit Texas Holdem. In Fixed Limit Texas Holdem, players can bet only a certain fixed amount per betting round.

The basic rules of Texas holdem poker are as follows:

1) All players are dealt two hole cards face down.

2) The player with the strongest hand based on their two hole cards starts the action by making a bet. This player is known as the preflop raiser or initiator.

3) The other players then have a chance to either call (match) the bet, raise (increase) the bet or fold (drop out).

4) If there has been no raise, the player who made the initial bet has an option to check (pass), meaning that they want to see what the next player has before deciding whether to raise or not.

5) Once all active players have either checked or raised, three community cards are placed face up in the middle of the table (the flop). These cards are used by all players to make their best five card hand.

6) Another round of betting takes place, starting with the preflop raiser and going clockwise around the table. This time, bets can be made for any amount equal to or less than the size of the pot. So, for example, if there was a $10 pot and someone bets $10, they can only call another $10 bet; they cannot raise because it would take them over $10 total (pot size + bet). The exception to this rule is when there are only two active players remaining in a hand; in this case, both players may continue betting in increments of whatever size they like (as long as it's still within bounds).

7) Once all active players have either called or folded, another community card (the turn) is placed face up on top of the flop card. Another round of betting takes place starting with the preflop raiser and going clockwise around table. This time bets can be made for any amount equal to or less than double what was wagered on previous round i.e $20 maximum per betting round no matter what size pot has developed). Players now have seven cards from which to form their best 5-card hand including their 2 hole cards and 5 community cards).
