#  10 steps to overcoming a gambling addiction 

Gambling addictions can be some of the most difficult to overcome. However, there are ways to fight back and reclaim your life. Here are 10 steps that you can take to overcome your gambling addiction:

1) Seek professional help. This is probably the most important step that you can take. There are many qualified professionals who can help you deal with your addiction.

2) Identify the triggers for your gambling addiction. What causes you to start gambling? Is it boredom, stress, or a feeling of euphoria? Once you know what your triggers are, you can work on avoiding them or dealing with them in a healthier way.

3) Avoid all forms of gambling. This includes online gambling, casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. The more you stay away from gambling, the easier it will be to overcome your addiction.

4) Commit to being accountable. Tell your family and friends about your addiction and ask for their support. Keep them updated on your progress and let them know if you need help or encouragement along the way.

5) Be honest with yourself about the extent of your problem. Gambling addictions can be very secretive and isolating, but it’s important to be honest about how much time and money you’re spending on gambling. This will help you figure out how much help you need and how serious your addiction is.

6) Make a budget and stick to it. When you’re trying to overcome an addiction, it’s important to be as responsible as possible with your money. Create a budget and stick to it as closely as possible – this will help keep temptation at bay.

7) Get involved in other activities outside of gambling. When you have other things going on in your life outside of gambling, it will be less appealing to turn to casinos or online poker games for entertainment. Try picking up new hobbies or interests, or find ways to get more involved in activities that you enjoy already.

8 ) Set realistic goals for yourself and strive to meet them . Don’t expect yourself to become completely abstinent from gambling overnight – that’s not realistic or healthy . Instead , set small goals for yourself such as staying away from casinos for a week or not betting more than $ 20 on any one game . As you meet these goals , gradually increase the difficulty so that eventually , overcoming your addiction will feel like less of a challenge . 
It's also important not beat yourself up if you slip up occasionally . Accepting that mistakes are part of the process is an important step in recovering from any addiction .   9 ) Seek out support groups specific to gambling addictions . There are many different support groups available both offline and online which can offer guidance , advice , and camaraderie from people who are going through the same thing as you are .   10 Finally , remember that overcoming a gambling addiction is not easy but it is definitely doable with hard work and dedication
