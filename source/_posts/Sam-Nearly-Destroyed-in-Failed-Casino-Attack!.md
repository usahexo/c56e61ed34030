#  Who Tried to Destroy Sam in Casino? 

In the movie "Casino" Sam Rothstein is seemingly destroyed by a number of individuals, but who was really responsible for his downfall?

The answer lies with several individuals, including his ex-wife Ginger, her new husband Lester Diamond, and Mafia boss Tony Dogs. Each of them played a role in manipulating Sam into making poor choices that led to his ultimate downfall.

Ginger was the most instrumental in destroying Sam. She used her charms to lure him into casinos and then convinced him to invest in her schemes. Lester Diamond also helped convince Sam to invest in schemes, as well as providing him with bad information that caused him to lose money.

Tony Dogs was the final piece of the puzzle. He convinced Sam that he could help protect him from the other mobsters, but eventually turned on him and caused him to lose everything. In the end, it was a coordinated effort by these individuals that led to Sam's destruction.

#  Failed Casino Attack Leaves Sam Unharmed 

Sam had been planning his casino attack for weeks. He’d studied the security footage and knew the layout of the building inside out. He had even rehearsed the robbery several times, but when it came time to put his plan into action, things started to go wrong.

First, one of his accomplices got cold feet and backed out at the last minute. Then, as Sam was making his getaway, he stumbled and dropped his gun. Finally, as he was trying to escape through a window, he slipped and fell onto the concrete below.

Luckily, Sam wasn’t seriously injured in the fall and was able to make a clean getaway. But despite his lack of success, he can take comfort in knowing that he came close to robbing one of the most secure casinos in the city.
