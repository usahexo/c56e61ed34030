How To Code A Blackjack Game In Java: Part 1

This series is intended for people with an understanding of basic Java. It will walk through creating a blackjack game from scratch. This first part will cover setting up the project and defining constants.

1. Create a new project in your favorite IDE. I'm using Eclipse, so I'll call my project Blackjack.
2. In the src folder, create a new package called com.blackjack and then create a new class called GameContext.java
3. Add the following code to GameContext.java: 
package com.blackjack;
import java.util.*;
public class GameContext {


private final String NAME = "Blackjack"; // Name of the game 
private final int DEALERSHIP = 6; // Number of dealers 
private final int PLAYERS = 2; // Number of players 
private final int CARDSINDECK = 52; // Number of cards in deck 
private final int NUMBEROFHANDS = 10; // Number of hands to play 
private final double BETSIZE = 0.5; // Size of bet 
private final int MAXBETSIZE = 100; // Maximum bet size 

// Initialize game state variables 
int player1Counter=0, player2Counter=0, dealer1Counter=0, dealer2Counter=0;
String playerName1="", playerName2="", dealerName="";

}

4. Next, add the following code to the main() method in GameContext.java: 
public static void main(String[] args) {

try { // Create new game context object and initialize it GameContext context = new GameContext(); context.init(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }

System . out . println ( "You are about to begin a round of blackjack with " +context . getNumberOfPlayers()+ " players." ); System . out . println ( "The dealer's card count is " +context . getDealership());

// Ask for player input - must enter name for first player Scanner keyboard = new Scanner (System . in ); System . out . print ( "Enter name for first player: " ); playerName1 = keyboard . nextLine (); System . out . println ( "\tWelcome, " +playerName1+ "!" );

// Repeat for second player Scanner keyboard2 = new Scanner (System . in ); System . out . print ( "Enter name for second player: " ); playerName2 = keyboard2 . nextLine (); System . out . println ( "\tWelcome, " +playerName2+ "!" );

double amountBought = 0; // Total amount bought by all players so far int currentPlayerIndex = 1; // Index of current player while (!keyboard . hasNextLine ()) { String input ; input = keyboard . nextLine (); if (!context . checkInput(input)) { throw new RuntimeException("Invalid input"); } else { amountBought += Double . parseDouble (input); currentPlayerIndex++; } }

System . out . println (); System . out . println ( "\tin round #" +currentPlayerIndex+ ", you have bought " +amountBought+ " chips." ); System . out . println ();

betAmounts[currentPlayerIndex] = amountBought; // Store bet amount in array balance[currentPlayerIndex] += amountBought * BETA / 100; // Update chip count and monetary balance if (betAmounts[currentPlayerIndex] <= MAXBETSIZE) { betAmounts[currentPlayerIndex] += BETA; balance[currentPlayerIndex] -= BETSIZE * BETA / 100;} else { betAmounts[currentPlayerIndex] *= 2;}

if (!keyboard2anquery()) SystemStopped(); else dealerSecondcards dealt ++ ;
}

} 5. Finally, add the following constants to the class:  public static final String NAME ="Blackjack"; public static final int DEALERSHIP=6 ; public static final int PLAYERS=2 ; public static final int CARDSINDECK=52 ; public static final int NUMBEROFFEARDS=10 ; public static double BETA=0.5 ; public static int MAXBETSIZE=100 ; 6 Save your work and run it! You should see the following output: You are about to begin a round of blackjack with 2 players The dealer's card count is 6 Enter name for first player: Joe Welcome, Joe! Enter name for second player: Alice Welcome, Alice! in round #1, you have bought 20 chips.

#  How To Code A Basic Blackjack Game In Java

In this article, we will be learning how to code a basic blackjack game in Java. We will go over the basics of card counting and how to keep track of the player's score. We will also learn how to deal cards and how to determine whether or not the player has won.

Let's start by creating a new project in Eclipse. We will name our project "Blackjack". Next, we need to create a class called "Player". The Player class will represent the player in our game. It will contain the following methods:

new() - This method will create a new Player object.
It will take two parameters: name and rank.
name - This parameter will store the name of the player. 
rank - This parameter will store the rank of the card (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc).

hit() - This method will tell the player to hit their next card. 
stand() - This method will tell the player to stand on their current hand. 
double() - This method will tell the player to double their bet and receive one more card. 
insurance() - This method will allow the player to purchase insurance against losing their hand.  
compare(Player other) - This method compares two Player objects and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the first player is ahead of or behind the second player.


Now let's add some code to our class file:
import java.util.*; //This imports the util library, which contains useful classes for working with data 

public class Player { //This is our Player class String name; //The name of our player int rank; //The rank of our card public Player(String name, int rank) { this.name = name; this.rank = rank; } public void hit() { //When hit is called, we want to ask the user for another card System.out .print("Hit? "); Scanner input = new Scanner(System .in); int inputNumber = input .nextInt(); if (inputNumber > 0) { this .rank = this .rank + 1; } else {System .exit(0);} } public void stand() { //When stand is called, we want to ask the user if they want to stay on their current hand System .out .print("Stand? "); Scanner input = new Scanner(System .in); int inputNumber = input .nextInt(); if (inputNumber == 0) {System .exit(0);} } public void double() { //When double is called, we want to double the bet and receive one more card System .out .print("Double? "); Scanner input = new Scanner(System .in); int inputNumber = input .nextInt(); if (inputNumber == 1) { this .betAmount *= 2; } else {System .exit(0);} } public boolean insurance() { //This allows players to purchase insurance against losing their hand return true; } public boolean compare(Player other) { //This compares two Player objects and returns a boolean indicating whether or not they are ahead or behind each other return (this.rank > other.rank) ? true : false; } }

#  How To Create A Blackjack Game In Java From Scratch

In this article, we are going to create a blackjack game from scratch in Java.

First, we will create the classes for the game. We will have a class for the player, the dealer, and the deck of cards.

The player class will have the following fields:

* id: The id of the player.

* name: The name of the player.

* points: The points of the player.

* money: The money of the player.

The dealer class will have the following fields:

* id: The id of the dealer.

* name: The name of the dealer.

* points: The points of the dealer.


  * money: The money of the dealer.

  Next, we will create a Deck class that will have the following fields: 

  * cards: An array of Card objects. 

  * suit: A String representing the suit of each card. 

  * rank: A String representing the rank of each card.

  * faceUp: A boolean indicating if each card is face up or not. 

 Now that we have our classes created, we can write our main() method where we will create instances of each class and play a game of blackjack. Let's take a look at our code now: import java . util . ArrayList ; import java . util . List ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [] args ) { Player player = new Player (); Dealer dealer = new Dealer (); Deck deck = new Deck (); deck . add ( new Card ( "2" , "heart" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "3" , "clubs" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "4" , "diamonds" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "5" , "spades" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "6" , "heart" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "7" , "clubs" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "8" , "diamonds" )); deck . add ( new Card ( "9" , "spades" )); dealerturn (); System . out . println (); System . out . println (( player . points + 10 ) + "/21 || \t \t \t \t \t \t Dealer's Point total is:" + dealer . points ); } private static void dealerturn () { List < Card > hand = new ArrayList <>(); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; ++ i ) { hand . add ( deck . remove ()); } int totalPoints = 0 ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < hand . size (); ++ j ) { totalPoints += Handles :: getValueAsIntPoint ((( Handles ) hand . get ( j )). rank ); } if ((totalPoints == 21 )) { System . out . println ( "\t\t\tDealer busted! Winner is:" + player ); } else { System . out . println ((dealer . points + 10 ) + "/21 || \t \t \t Dealer's Point total is:" + dealer ); } } private static int Handles :: getValueAsIntPoint (( String valueRank )) { if (! valueRank . equalsIgnoreCase (( char ) Integer .) && valueRank != null ) { return Integer .) valueRank ; } else { return - 1 ; } } }

#  How To Code A Blackjack Game With JavaFX

In this article, we are going to create a blackjack game with JavaFX.

First, we will create the user interface. We need a text field to enter the player's name, a text field to enter the dealer's name, a deck of cards, and a panel to display the results of the game.

We will also create some buttons to help us control the game. The first button will be used to draw cards, the second button will be used to discard cards, the third button will be used to bet, and the fourth button will be used to end the game.

Here is how our user interface will look:



 

The next step is to code the functionality for our user interface. We will start by creating two classes, one for the player and one for the dealer. We will also create a class for our deck of cards.

The Player class will include methods for dealing cards, drawing cards, and discarding cards. The Dealer class will include methods for dealing cards and checking whether or not the player has won or lost. The DeckOfCards class will simply contain an array of Card objects.

Here is what our classes will look like:



 
Now that we have our classes in place, we can start coding the functionality for our user interface. Let's start with the DrawCardButton class. This class will contain a method called drawCard that takes a Card object as input and draws it from the deck. It will then return the card to the caller. Here is how it should look:



 
The DiscardCardButton class will have a method called discardCard that takes a Card object as input and removes it from play. Here is how it should look:



 
Now let's take a look at the BetButton class. This class will have a method called bet that takes an int value as input. This value indicates how much money the player wants to bet on their hand. Here is how it should look:



 " title="Now let's take a look at the BetButton class. This class will have a method called bet that takes an int value as input. This value indicates how much money

#  Getting Started With Java: Creating A Blackjack Game

In this article, you will learn how to create a Blackjack game in Java.

You will start by creating the project and setting up the basic structure of the game. Next, you will add the code to handle the basic gameplay mechanics. Finally, you will add some polish to the game, including animations and sounds.

So let's get started!

# Creating The Project

The first thing you need to do is create a new Java project. You can do this by going to File > New > Project... in your IDE.

Next, select "Java" from the list of available options and click on "Next".

Now enter "Blackjack" as the name of your project and click on "Finish".

# The Basic Structure Of The Game

Now that you have created your project, it's time to start coding! The first thing you need to do is create the class that will represent your Blackjack game. This class will contain all of the code related to gameplay. So go ahead and create a new Java class called "BlackjackGame".

Next, you need to add some variables to your class. These variables will store data about the current state of the game. Here's what they should look like:

























 withdealerAs_card = kingOfHearts; //this is for our purposes only - we'll replace it later with a random card[] deck = new card[52]; boolean playerHasBlackjack = false; int pointsPlayer = 0; int pointsDealer = 0; int currentPlayer bettingUnit = 5; //points at which player changes bet size int currentDealer bettingUnit = 10; //points at which dealer changes bet size String dealerName = ""; String playerName = ""; int[] playercards = new int[2]; // an array for holding player's cards }
