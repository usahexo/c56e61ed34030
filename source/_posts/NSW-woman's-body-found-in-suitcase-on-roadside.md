#  NSW woman's body found in suitcase on roadside

On Wednesday, the body of a 25-year-old woman was found inside a suitcase on the side of a road in Sydney's southwest. According to authorities, the woman had been stabbed multiple times.

The victim, who has not yet been identified, is believed to be from NSW. So far, no arrests have been made in connection with her death.

This tragic story comes just weeks after another woman's body was found inside a suitcase in Melbourne. In that case, the victim - also aged 25 - had been stabbed to death.

While it is still too early to say for certain, it is possible that these two cases are linked.

As the investigation continues, police are urging anyone with information about either of these murders to come forward.

#  Christina Engelhardt's body found in Casino dead cash Australia 

The body of Christina Engelhardt, 38, was found on Saturday inside her Casino home by police responding to a reported disturbance. 
Engelhardt's death is being treated as suspicious, and a post-mortem examination will be conducted to determine the cause of death. 
Investigators are appealing for information from the public, and say they believe Engelhardt's death is linked to an attempted robbery at the same address several days earlier.

On Wednesday 4 October 2017 police were called to a disturbance at a home on Johnston Street in Casino. It's understood that an attempted robbery had taken place at the address, and that Engelhardt had suffered injuries as a result. 
She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital for treatment but later died.
