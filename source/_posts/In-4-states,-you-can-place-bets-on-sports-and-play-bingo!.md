#  In 4 states, you can place bets on sports and play bingo!

When you think about gambling, what comes to mind? Las Vegas, right? With all of its glitz and glamour, Sin City is the mecca for anyone looking to place a bet. But did you know that there are other gambling hotspots in the United States? In fact, four states allow you to place bets on sports and play bingo at the same time!

If you’re looking for a unique gambling experience, be sure to check out one of these four states.

 Delaware

In Delaware, you can gamble at three racetracks – Dover Downs, Harrington Raceway, and Delaware Park. All three tracks offer simulcast betting, which allows you to bet on horse races from around the country. Dover Downs also has a casino with table games and slot machines. If you’re looking for some excitement, be sure to check out Harrington Raceway – it offers both harness racing and thoroughbred racing.

Mississippi

Mississippi is home to 16 casinos, which means there’s plenty of opportunity to place a bet. The most well-known casino in Mississippi is probably the Beau Rivage Resort & Casino in Biloxi. This casino has more than 2,000 slot machines and over 100 table games. If you’re looking for something a bit smaller, try the Casino Queen in Vicksburg – it has 135 slot machines and six table games.

New Jersey

In New Jersey, there are two types of gambling – racetrack betting and casino gambling. Atlantic City is home to 11 casinos, including Caesars Atlantic City Hotel & Casino, Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City, and Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel Casino. If you want to try your luck on the horses, head over to Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport or Meadowlands Racing & Entertainment in East Rutherford.

West Virginia

West Virginia is home to some of the country’s biggest casino resorts. The Mountaineer Casino Racetrack & Resort in Chester is one of the largest gaming facilities in North America, with more than 150 table games and 3,000 slot machines. Another popular casino resort is The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs – this resort features a casino with over 500 slot machines and 25 table games.

Officials from the Department of Justice announced on Monday that they would not stand in the way of legalized sports betting in four states – Nevada, Delaware, Montana, and Oregon.

The decision was seen as a victory by many in the gaming industry, who have been pushing for years for the legalization of sports betting. One casino executive called it a "landmark day for the industry."

"I applaud today's announcement by the Department of Justice," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. "The DoJ has confirmed what we have known all along: that sports betting is a skill game that can be enjoyed by millions of Americans without harm to society."

But while officials were clear about their support for sports betting, they offered no opinion on bingo – which is also legal in all four states.

"Congress has not acted on bingo and other forms of gaming," Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate told reporters on Monday. "That's a matter for Congress."
