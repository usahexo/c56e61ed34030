#  Blackjack is More Random Than You Think!

Even if you’re a seasoned blackjack player, you may be surprised to learn that the game is more random than you think. In fact, many experts believe that blackjack is a game of pure chance, and that no amount of skill can help you beat the house edge.

That said, there are still some things you can do to improve your odds at the table. For example, always stick to basic strategy, and avoid making unnecessary bets. And if you’re playing at a casino, be sure to take advantage of any bonus offers they have available.

Ultimately, though, blackjack is a game of chance, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll win every time you play. So if you’re looking for a game with more consistent results, you may want to try something else.

#  Mahjong is More Arbitrary Than Slot Machines!

Mahjong is known to be one of the most popular tile-based games in the world. The game has many variants, but the basic premise is to remove all of the tiles from the board by matching them with others that are free. However, Mahjong is more arbitrary than slot machines!

Since slot machines payout percentages are regulated by casino gaming authorities, players can expect a certain degree of fairness and reliability when playing slots. However, there is no such guarantee with Mahjong – in fact, the game can be downright unfair at times!

For example, consider the “Four Winds” rule in some variants of Mahjong. This rule allows players to exchange any two tiles on their rack for another tile on the board. This can lead to some very unfair outcomes, as it effectively gives players an extra turn. So if you are unlucky enough to be stuck with a bad hand, your opponent may be able to take advantage of the Four Winds rule and win the game easily!

In comparison, slots payout percentages are determined by a random number generator (RNG), so there is no way for players to exploit this mechanic in order to gain an advantage. As such, it is much fairer than Mahjong in this respect.

Of course, there are other rules (and variations) that can make Mahjong unfair, such as the “dead wall” rule. This rule allows player to claim any tile from the discard pile, even if it results in a dead end for them. So if your opponent discards a tile that you need for your mahjong hand, you can simply claim it and end the game! There is no equivalent rule in slots gaming – once a player has run out of money, they cannot continue playing.

Overall, it is clear that Mahjong is more arbitrary than slot machines – something that should be taken into account when deciding which game to play!

#  Are Games of Chance Really That arbitrary?

Games of chance have been around for centuries and have been enjoyed by people of all ages. While some may see these games as nothing more than a way to pass the time, others believe that there is more to it than that. Some claim that games of chance are actually quite arbitrary, with the outcome having nothing to do with the players' skills or abilities. So, what is the truth behind games of chance?

In truth, games of chance are not completely arbitrary. There is some element of luck involved, but player skill does play a role as well. This is because games of chance involve mathematical probability. In order to win, players need to understand the odds and make calculated bets based on those odds.

That said, there is no denying that luck does play a role in many games of chance. For example, in dice games, the outcome is largely determined by the roll of the dice. This means that players cannot predict the outcome with complete certainty and must rely on luck as well as their understanding of probability.

So, what role does player skill play in games of chance? In general, it plays a smaller role than luck. However, understanding the odds and making correct bets can give players an edge over the house edge and increase their chances of winning. Players who are skilled at gambling can often make money playing casino games such as blackjack or poker.

While luck definitely plays a role in most games of chance, player skill can still be important in determining the outcome. If you're interested in trying your hand at gambling, it's important to learn about the different types of games and understand how they work before you start playing. With a bit of practice and knowledge, you may be able to turn your luck around and start winning some real money!
