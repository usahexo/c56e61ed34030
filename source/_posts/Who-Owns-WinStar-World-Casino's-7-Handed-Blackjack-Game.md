#  Who Owns WinStar World Casino's 7 Handed Blackjack Game?

In the world of casino gambling, blackjack is one of the most popular games. Many people enjoy the challenge of trying to beat the dealer and win big payouts. WinStar World Casino's 7 Handed Blackjack Game is a variation of the traditional blackjack game that offers players a more exciting experience. So who owns this version of blackjack?

The answer to that question is a bit complicated. The game was created by Geoff Hall, who holds a patent on the design. However, casinos are not required to pay royalties to Hall for using the game, so many casinos choose not to do so. This includes WinStar World Casino.

Hall has publicly stated that he does not mind if casinos use his game without paying him royalties, as long as they give players a fair chance of winning. He also believes that casinos should not be allowed to offer bonus payouts for blackjack hands that contain an ace and a king, queen or jack (a so-called "blackjack"). Hall feels that these bonus payouts give players an unfair advantage over the casino.

Despite Hall's stance on bonus payouts, WinStar World Casino continues to offer them on its 7 Handed Blackjack Game. This has led to some legal battles between Hall and the casino. So far, Hall has been unsuccessful in his efforts to get WinStar World Casino to stop offering these bonuses.

#  Mystery Casino Owner Claims WinStar World Blackjack Game

Reporters from all around the state descended on the tribal casino in Thackerville, Oklahoma after rumors of a large win by one of the casino's owners began to circulate. The owner, who has asked to remain anonymous, says that they hit a blackjack hand worth over $1 million while playing at the WinStar World Casino.

"I was pretty shocked when I saw the results," said the owner. "I've played blackjack for years, but I've never had a hand like that."

The casino has refused to comment on the matter, but sources close to the situation say that officials are still investigating the validity of the win. If it is confirmed, it would be one of the largest single payouts in the history of tribal casinos.

Blackjack is a game that relies heavily on luck, but there are certain strategies that can increase your chances of winning.

#  Who is the Unknown Owner of the WinStar World Casino 7 Handed Blackjack game?

On a recent trip to the WinStar World Casino and Resort in Oklahoma, I discovered an intriguing mystery. I was playing a game of blackjack at one of the 7-handed tables when I noticed that the dealer had a strange patch on their inner arm, just below their elbow. It looked like a tattoo of some kind, but the design was unfamiliar to me.

I asked the dealer about it and they said that the patch was a gift from the unknown owner of the game. Intrigued, I asked who this mysterious person was, but the dealer refused to tell me, saying only that the owner was "a very special person".

I did some digging online and found out that the WinStar World Casino is one of only a few casinos in the world that offer this blackjack game. The other casinos are all owned by secret societies or criminal organizations, so it's possible that the unknown owner of this game is also one of those groups.

But who could it be? There's no record of any member of these secret societies or criminal organizations having ownership or controlling interest in the WinStar World Casino, so it's anyone's guess as to who this mystery person might be.

My best guess is that it's some kind of anonymous wealthy individual who enjoys playing blackjack and wants to keep their identity hidden. Whoever it is, they're clearly very secretive and mysterious!
